            <blockquote>
                <h3>Non-tuition college expenses include: </h3>
                <p><strong>All the above</strong>; As a student planning for college,
                    you’ll need to take all of your expenses for school-related and
                    extra-curricular activities into account as you look at your financial needs.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <!-- Q2 -->
            <blockquote>
                <h3>Federal financial assistance for college is only available for those struggling to make ends meet. </h3>
                <p><strong>False</strong>; Both parents and students often think that federal assistance is available only to those who are struggling financially.
                    As a result, many families bypass the federal financial aid process thinking they earn too much or have too many assets to
                    qualify for federal programs. Regardless of your income,
                    all families should complete the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) each year.
                    It’s easy to do. Go to fafsa.edu.gov any time after January 1 to apply for the upcoming academic year.</p>

            <!-- Q3 -->
            <blockquote>
                <h3>If you need extra funding to cover your education costs,
                    there are government and private financing options available. </h3>
                <p><strong>True</strong>; If the funding you receive on your award letter doesn’t cover your total costs, explore other financing options.
                    Your family’s circumstances and preferences will help determine what funding option may fit your situation.
                    As you explore your options, it’s important to: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Research all financing programs carefully.</li>
                    <li>Compare eligibility requirements, interest rates, costs and fees, repayment options,
                        and monthly payments of the financing programs
                        you’re considering.</li>
                    <li>Line up a cosigner to help you qualify for a private student loan,
                        which may result in a lower interest rate and quicker credit
                        decision.</li>
                    <li>Seriously consider the amount you plan to borrow so you don’t overextend yourself with too much student loan debt.</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Q4 -->
            <blockquote>
                <h3>Using a college credit card in a responsible manner can help you build credit. </h3>
                <p><strong>True</strong>; Unlike a debit card or prepaid card,
                    when you responsibly use a credit card in your name to buy the things you need,
                    you establish a credit history. Good credit gives you more choices,
                    because it can help you rent an apartment, set up utility
                    services, and qualify you for better rates if you buy a car.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <!-- Q5 -->
            <blockquote>
                <h3>If you’re a college student,
                    your possessions are automatically fully covered while living on campus. </h3>
                <p><strong>False</strong>; Coverage for your valuables is not automatically guaranteed when you live on campus.
                    You may want to consider renters insurance to protect your belongings and auto insurance if you take a car
                    to school and you’re not covered under your parent’s policy any more.</p>
