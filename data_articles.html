            <h2>Credit history — your financial magic 8-ball </h2>
            <p>You may start receiving credit card offers when you’re at college.
                These years can be a good time to practice responsible credit card
                habits and establish your credit history with a card like
                the <a target="_blank" href="http://adfarm.mediaplex.com/ad/ck/6214-181812-3408-24">
                    Wells Fargo Cash Back<sup>SM</sup> College Card</a><sup>1</sup>.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>Apply for the credit card in your name, and use it wisely to make purchases and pay bills.
                As your purchase activity and payment information is reported to the major credit bureaus,
                you’ll start building a good credit history.
                Think of this predictor as your financial magic 8-ball, only much more reliable. </p>
            <h4> Credit basics </h4>
            <p>Remember credit cards aren’t free money.
                Using them means you’re borrowing money that you agree to repay within a certain timeframe.
                There is a cost called interest, and it’s calculated as a percentage of your balance.
                You’re responsible for repaying what you borrow plus
                the added interest. </p>
            <h4> Credit history is important </h4>
            <p>You may want to live off campus sometime during college, get an apartment after school, or buy a car someday.
                Before landlords rent to you, they can view your credit report.
                So can utility companies, lenders, and prospective employers.
                Having good credit gives you flexibility, more choices,
                and helps you qualify for better loan rates as you reach these milestones. </p>
            <h4> How to establish good credit </h4>
            <p>Fortunately, a roll of the magic 8-ball has nothing to do with establishing good credit.
                Instead, use a credit card responsibly, pay
                your bills on time, and follow these rules to help you stay on track: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Borrow only what you can repay. </li>
                <li>Know your credit limit and stay within it. </li>
                <li>Make at least the minimum payment due on time every time. </li>
                <li>Pay off your debt as promised. </li>
                <li>Avoid cash advances except in an emergency. </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <p><sup>1</sup> To qualify for the <em>Wells Fargo Cash Back </em> College Credit Card,
                students must be the age of majority/emancipation in the state
                of residence, show proof of enrollment in an accredited college, university, or trade school,
                and meet other credit qualifications.
                Applicants must be able to demonstrate the ability to individually repay their debt.
                Applicants who do not meet these criteria will be
                required to obtain a co-applicant with an ability to repay the debt.
                Students with an income of more than $12,000 a year should apply for
                the Wells Fargo Platinum Credit Card instead. </p>

            <h2>Your car and college </h2>
            <h4> Your finances after graduation </h4>
            <p>It may be hard to believe now, but college can come and go in a flash.
                Before you know it, you’ll graduate, and that’s an exciting time.
                You may be looking for your first job or moving to a new city. </p>
            <hr>
            <p>The less exciting part is the financial side of life when more bills kick in.
                On top of bills you may have paid in college, like a cell phone and credit card, there are rent, utilities, and food to consider.
                If student loans were part of paying for college, you’ll need to start repaying those after a few months, too. Then, there’s a car.
                You may land that first job and have a new car payment to go with it. </p>
            <p>If you find yourself a little anxious about the new expenses and swear off ramen noodles just to pinch pennies, stay calm.
                A lot of people don’t think about the car they drive everyday as a way to improve their finances.
                But it can be, and we can help with that. </p>
            <p>Often times, customers can combine higher-rate debt into what they already owe for their car at a lower interest rate.
                This is called an auto refinance loan, and the payoff can be: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower monthly payments overall <em>(i.e. more money left for what you like to do) </em> </li>
                <li>Less interest paid over time <em>(In other words, keep more of your money in the long run, too.) </em> </li>
                <li>Fewer bills to remember every month <em>(There’s already enough going on, right?) </em> </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may not need it today, but refinancing a vehicle can be one reliable way to help ease financial pressure.
                If your parents or someone else who is helping you with college costs could use a little room in the monthly budget,
                refinancing a vehicle may be a good opportunity for them, too. </p>

            <h2> Taking a car to college – smart or not? </h2>
            <p>It may not be right away, but at some point, you may need a reliable car while you’re in college.
                It may be the car you drive now, or you may need something different.
                For some students, it may not make sense at all.
                These considerations may help you and your parents decide what’s best for your situation. </p>
            <hr>
            <h4> Are you heading out-of-state or attending an in-state school? </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Will you live on campus or plan to commute? </li>
                <li>If you have a vehicle now, what condition is it in? </li>
                <li>Decide how much you’re really going to drive to decide if it’s worth it. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Consider the costs </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>How often will you fill up the gas tank, and what should you budget for that cost? </li>
                <li>Is there a monthly charge for parking, or is it free? </li>
                <li>What about insurance? Talk with your insurance company to find out if you’ll remain on your parent’s policy while you’re in college.
                    If not, what should you budget each month for auto insurance? </li>
                <li>As you put miles on the car, remember maintenance costs from wear and tear. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> <strong>TIP: </strong> Many campuses are walking campuses, so you may not use a car every day, if at all. </p>
            <h4> Where will you live?</h4>
            <p> If you live on campus, most things may be within walking distance.
                And, many college cities and towns have good public transportation that
                can get you just about everywhere else. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider where dorms are in relation to classes, the bookstore, restaurants, and retail stores. </li>
                <li>During campus visits, ask about bus routes or other public transportation. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Living off campus or commuting can change your transportation needs. </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Again, think about how far you’ll live from classes, the bookstore, restaurants, etc. </li>
                <li>Where are the commuter parking lots? </li>
                <li>Do you always need to use your own car, or can you carpool with a classmate? </li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Parking </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>When you drive to class, is there enough parking on campus? </li>
                <li>Would a smaller, compact car be more convenient to park? </li>
                <li>If you live on-campus and plan to walk most places,
                    is there a secure lot to leave your car when you’re not using it? </li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Think ahead </h4>
            <p> Further into your college experience, you may need a reliable way to drive farther distances for internships or job interviews. </p>
            <p>Whether you or your parents are in the market to buy a vehicle now or in a couple of years,
                we’re here to help with <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/autoloans/">financing</a>  new and pre-owned vehicles.
